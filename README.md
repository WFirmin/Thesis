### Abstract

Introductory Economics students learn that imposing a minimum wage decreases employment, but many studies find insignificant effects. The disconnect occurs when labor market concentration is not accounted for: in theory, employment decreases in perfect competition and increases in a monopsony. Controlling for this usually requires restricted data, so few studies have explored this source of heterogeneity. I construct a measure of labor market concentration using publicly available data and apply several approaches to estimating the employment effect of minimum wages across multiple data sets. The combined limitations of the data restricts my analysis to between 2000 and 2016. I take the methods from previous minimum wage literature and add my metric of concentration. The first two approaches regress employment on minimum wage, concentration, and other control variables, first at the sector and then individual level. The third uses a difference-in-differences approach in an event study across 13 treatment states. I find significant decreases in employment effects as competition increases, uncovering heterogeneity as theory would suggest. My findings provide an accessible measurement for labor market concentration and evidence for theory that corroborates recent literature.
